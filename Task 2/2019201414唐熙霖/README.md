# Task 2
Implementation of expression evaluator with floating-point support.

* Used my implementation of IEEE 754 floating-point number in Task 1.
* Support evaluating a expression with `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `()` and decimal numbers.
* Spaces between numbers and operators would be ignored if exists.
* Read expressions from `stdin` and write the value to `stdout` (both are one per line).

## Updates of my double ##

* Added a method of converting int to my implementation of double.
* Fixed a bug of rounding
