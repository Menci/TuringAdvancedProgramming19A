## Task 6
This is a program solving "Josephus problem".

-----------
### solution
Here I post a solution whose time complexity is $\Theta(nk)$.
By using GNU make, this program can be compiled

#### input / output
The input must consists and only consists $3$ integers $N, K, t$, which mean the number of people, the skip number, clockwise(1) or counterclockwise(0)

the program will output $N$ lines, each line contains one integer. the $i^{th}$ integer is the killed people's id in the $i^{th}$ round.
